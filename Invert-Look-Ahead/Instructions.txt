All of the VHDL files in this folder do not need changes for different bit precisions.

There are two files that need generated by `v3-ILA-Gen`:
- abs_look_ahead_####.vhd
- abs_sign_mag_wrapper_v3_####.vhd

Take all of these files, including mk8_container_abs_ila.vhd, alongside the following transceiver files, and place them into a Vivado project:
- mk8_rx_module.vhd
- mk8_tx_module.vhd
- mk8_xcvr_generic.vhd
- mk8_apex_####.vhd (modify [G_total_bits])
- nexys_mk8_apex.xdc OR basys3_mk8_apex.xdc (depending on target device)
- synchronizer_2ff.vhd
- d_flip_flop.vhd (not technically needed since this folder already has it)
